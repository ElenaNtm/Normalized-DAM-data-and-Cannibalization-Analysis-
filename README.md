# Normalized-DAM-data-and-Cannibalization-Analysis-
Normalized DAM data and Cannibalization Analysis for data from 2020 to 2023
The data come from the EnExGroup platform (Hellenic Power Exchange)
They have been normalized to see the difference in the data during the day and not durring the years, due to various factors we had a big difference in DAM prices over the past years.

As the data from previous years are in zip form in EnExGroup platform we are working with data from the local drive.

Information and the data can be found here: https://www.enexgroup.gr/el/markets-publications-el-day-ahead-market
